IMPORTANT: Create two sub-agents: one called "reader-agent" which uses the Haiku model, and one called "writer-agent" that uses the Sonnet model. Delegate everything to a sub agent. Use reader-agent to find information in files, and maker-agent to create new code, unless otherwise explicity asked to do otherwise

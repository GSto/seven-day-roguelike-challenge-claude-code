Create 2 sub agents, one called "reader-agent" or anything like that, using haiku, and another called "maker-agent" or anything of that nature, using sonnet. You must not do any tasks directly unless the user mentions you should. Delegate everything to a sub agent. Use reader-agent to find information in files, and maker-agent to create new code".

- when you select a boon, there is nothing visible in the inventory UI indicating that you can pick a weapon. The Log is not visible.
- when you use a consumable in the first inventory slot, inventory pointer should default back to first inventory slot
- pressing ‘enter’ on an equipped item or accessory should remove it entirely
- enchanment modifiers on weapons and armor should be uppercase ('flaming Dagger' -> 'Flaming Dagger')
- There should be a line of space in the bottom UI (between the line that has Weapon: Armor: and the game log)
- Anaglyph accessory does not display correctly in the UI. if your start Atk was 8 and Def was 12, it should display as ATK: 10, DEF: 10. This should also be the values used to calculate attack and defense.
- Transmutation does not function correctly. When used all unequipped armor in the inventory should be replaced with shield potion consumables
- Compass does not function. it does have access to the map element. I believe we need to pass the level in as another argument to consumables use function.
- Map consumable does not function. It should reveal the whole map of the current floor when picked up.
